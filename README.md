Run the offline algorithm against a single instance with python `>=3.10.0`, using `python solve_strike.py {case}`.
* Replace `{case}` with the name of the input file you want to use within our program, e.g. `1` or `2`.

To run a larger test script, run `python test_all.py`. This will run and compare the qThreshold and Random Online Algorithms to the optimal offline algorithm.
